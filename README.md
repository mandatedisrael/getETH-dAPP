# FREE ETH:fire:

This project is a basic CLI implementation of smart contract built with solidity comboed with Javascript which get deployed to a local ethereum network (Thanks to Hardhat!) and sends 300BTC to some randomly generated eth address, do a basic calculation and send the details back to the user.
